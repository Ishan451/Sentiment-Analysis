# Sentiment-Analysis

Perform tweet analysis using 3 classification models namely SVM, Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression. 
The data is first preprocessed by perfrorming stemming and lemmatization and cleaned by removing stopwords, punctuations and URLs from the tweets.
The tweets are then transformed by TF-IDF vectoriser and splitted into training and testing.
The code will plot ROC-AUC Curve, Confusion Matrix and display precision, recall and F1 score for all models.
